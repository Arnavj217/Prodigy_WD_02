This project is a simple and functional stopwatch created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It allows users to start, pause, and reset the timer with ease, making it ideal for basic time-tracking needs such as workouts, study sessions, or productivity tasks. 
The HTML provides the structure of the stopwatch interface, CSS is used for styling and layout to ensure a clean and responsive design, and JavaScript handles 
the core timing functionality and user interactions. The stopwatch works entirely in the browser without any external libraries or dependencies, making it 
lightweight and easy to use. To try it out, simply clone or download the repository and open the index.html file in any modern web browser
